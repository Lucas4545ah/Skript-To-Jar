# Skript To Jar FORKED

##Whats new in this fork

Well this is a up-todate skript version.
Nothing else

##How it works

It gets the github directory for skript, or https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/download/2.5.3/Skript.jar, then downloads that puts the skript in there and gives
you a jar.

##Install

Currently it is flaged as "Malicious file" on open with windows, but its not malicious. Just click "More Info" then click "Run anyway"

###Thats really it!
